# Vehicle Detection Project
Vehicle detection and tracking play crucial roles in intelligent transportation
systems, traffic management, and surveillance applications. It delves into diverse
detection techniques, tracking algorithms, and challenges such as occlusions.
Emphasizing real-time implementation and sensor fusion for enhanced accuracy,
the abstract highlights the technology's applications in smart cities and advanced
driver assistance systems. This research proposes an efficient solution for vehicle
detection and tracking using the Cascade Algorithm, a variant of Haar-like
features-based object detection. The Cascade Algorithm is known for its rapid
processing speed and accuracy, making it well-suited for real-time applications.
